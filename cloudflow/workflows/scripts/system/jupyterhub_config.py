## The ip address for the Hub process to *bind* to.

#  This is necessary for normal jupyterhub operation, as the Hub must receive
#  requests for e.g. `/user/:name` when the user's server is not running.
#  
#  However, some deployments using only the JupyterHub API may want to handle
#  these events themselves, in which case they can register their own default
#  target with the proxy and set e.g. `hub_routespec = /hub/` to serve only the

#  
#  Setting this to a positive value will redirect the user after this many
#  seconds, effectively clicking this button automatically for the users,

#  complete in the background and the http server is allowed to start.

#  
#  If you are not inserting additional tokens via configuration file, this flag

#  hashing because the hashing is costly and does not increase the entropy of

#  
#  User-provided tokens, on the other hand, are not trusted to have good entropy
#  by default, and are passed through many rounds of hashing to stretch the
#  entropy of the key (i.e. user-provided tokens are treated as passwords instead
#  of random keys). These keys are more costly to check.
#  
#  If your inserted tokens are generated by a good-quality mechanism, e.g.

# Spawner(LoggingConfigurable) configuration
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Base class for spawning single-user notebook servers.
#  
#  Subclass this, and override the following methods:
#  
#  - load_state - get_state - start - stop - poll
#  
#  As JupyterHub supports multiple users, an instance of the Spawner subclass is
#  created for each user. If there are 20 JupyterHub users, there will be 20
#  instances of the subclass.

## Extra arguments to be passed to the single-user server.
#  
#  Some spawners allow shell-style expansion here, allowing you to use
#  environment variables here. Most, including the default, do not. Consult the
#  documentation for your spawner to verify!
#c.Spawner.args = []

## An optional hook function that you can implement to pass `auth_state` to the
#  spawner after it has been initialized but before it starts. The `auth_state`
#  dictionary may be set by the `.authenticate()` method of the authenticator.
#  This hook enables you to pass some or all of that information to your spawner.
#  
#  Example::
#  
#      def userdata_hook(spawner, auth_state):
#          spawner.userdata = auth_state["userdata"]
#  
#      c.Spawner.auth_state_hook = userdata_hook

## The command used for starting the single-user server.
#  
#  Provide either a string or a list containing the path to the startup script
#  command. Extra arguments, other than this path, should be provided via `args`.
#  
#  This is usually set if you want to start the single-user server in a different
#  python environment (with virtualenv/conda) than JupyterHub itself.
#  
#  Some spawners allow shell-style expansion here, allowing you to use
#  environment variables. Most, including the default, do not. Consult the
#  documentation for your spawner to verify!
#c.Spawner.cmd = ['jupyterhub-singleuser']

## Maximum number of consecutive failures to allow before shutting down
#  JupyterHub.
#  
#  This helps JupyterHub recover from a certain class of problem preventing
#  launch in contexts where the Hub is automatically restarted (e.g. systemd,
#  docker, kubernetes).
#  
#  A limit of 0 means no limit and consecutive failures will not be tracked.
#c.Spawner.consecutive_failure_limit = 0

## Minimum number of cpu-cores a single-user notebook server is guaranteed to
#  have available.
#  
#  If this value is set to 0.5, allows use of 50% of one CPU. If this value is
#  set to 2, allows use of up to 2 CPUs.
#  
#  **This is a configuration setting. Your spawner must implement support for the
#  limit to work.** The default spawner, `LocalProcessSpawner`, does **not**
#  implement this support. A custom spawner **must** add support for this setting
#  for it to be enforced.

## The URL the single-user server should start in.
#  
#  `{username}` will be expanded to the user's username
#  
#  Example uses:
#  
#  - You can set `notebook_dir` to `/` and `default_url` to `/tree/home/{username}` to allow people to
#    navigate the whole filesystem from their notebook server, but still start in their home directory.
#  - Start with `/notebooks` instead of `/tree` if `default_url` points to a notebook instead of a directory.
#  - You can set this to `/lab` to have JupyterLab start by default, rather than Jupyter Notebook.
c.Spawner.default_url = '/lab'

## Disable per-user configuration of single-user servers.
#  
#  When starting the user's single-user server, any config file found in the
#  user's $HOME directory will be ignored.
#  
#  Note: a user could circumvent this if the user modifies their Python
#  environment, such as when they have their own conda environments / virtualenvs
#  / containers.
#c.Spawner.disable_user_config = False

## List of environment variables for the single-user server to inherit from the
#  JupyterHub process.
#

#  single-user server's process.
#c.Spawner.env_keep = ['PATH', 'PYTHONPATH', 'CONDA_ROOT', 'CONDA_DEFAULT_ENV', 'VIRTUAL_ENV', 'LANG', 'LC_ALL', 'JUPYTERHUB_SINGLEUSER_APP']

## Extra environment variables to set for the single-user server's process.
#  
#  Environment variables that end up in the single-user server's process come from 3 sources:
#    - This `environment` configurable
#    - The JupyterHub process' environment variables that are listed in `env_keep`
#    - Variables to establish contact between the single-user notebook and the hub (such as JUPYTERHUB_API_TOKEN)
#  
#  The `environment` configurable should be set by JupyterHub administrators to
#  add installation specific environment variables. It is a dict where the key is
#  the name of the environment variable, and the value can be a string or a
#  callable. If it is a callable, it will be called with one parameter (the
#  spawner instance), and should return a string fairly quickly (no blocking
#  operations please!).
#  
#  Note that the spawner class' interface is not guaranteed to be exactly same
#  across upgrades, so if you are using the callable take care to verify it
#  continues to work after upgrades!
#  
#  .. versionchanged:: 1.2

#c.Spawner.http_timeout = 30

## The URL the single-user server should connect to the Hub.
#  
#  If the Hub URL set in your JupyterHub config is not reachable from spawned

#  Is None if you don't need to change the URL.
#c.Spawner.hub_connect_url = None

## The IP address (or hostname) the single-user server should listen on.
#  
#  Usually either '127.0.0.1' (default) or '0.0.0.0'.
#  
#  The JupyterHub proxy implementation should be able to send packets to this
#  interface.
#  
#  Subclasses which launch remotely or in containers should override the default
#  to '0.0.0.0'.
#  
#  .. versionchanged:: 2.0
#      Default changed to '127.0.0.1', from ''.
#      In most cases, this does not result in a change in behavior,

#c.Spawner.ip = '127.0.0.1'

## Minimum number of bytes a single-user notebook server is guaranteed to have
#  available.
#  
#  Allows the following suffixes:
#    - K -> Kilobytes
#    - M -> Megabytes
#    - G -> Gigabytes
#    - T -> Terabytes
#  
#  **This is a configuration setting. Your spawner must implement support for the

#    - T -> Terabytes
#  
#  If the single user server tries to allocate more memory than this, it will
#  fail. There is no guarantee that the single-user notebook server will be able
#  to allocate this much memory - only that it can not allocate more than this.
#  
#  **This is a configuration setting. Your spawner must implement support for the

#c.Spawner.mem_limit = None

## Path to the notebook directory for the single-user server.
#  
#  The user sees a file listing of this directory when the notebook interface is
#  started. The current interface does not easily allow browsing beyond the
#  subdirectories in this directory's tree.
#  
#  `~` will be expanded to the home directory of the user, and {username} will be
#  replaced with the name of the user.
#  
#  Note that this does *not* prevent users from accessing files outside of this
#  path! They can do so with many other means.
#c.Spawner.notebook_dir = ''

## Allowed roles for oauth tokens.
#  
#  This sets the maximum and default roles assigned to oauth tokens issued by a
#  single-user server's oauth client (i.e. tokens stored in browsers after
#  authenticating with the server), defining what actions the server can take on
#  behalf of logged-in users.
#  
#  Default is an empty list, meaning minimal permissions to identify users, no
#  actions can be taken on their behalf.
#c.Spawner.oauth_roles = traitlets.Undefined

## An HTML form for options a user can specify on launching their server.
#  
#  The surrounding `<form>` element and the submit button are already provided.
#  
#  For example:
#  
#  .. code:: html
#  
#      Set your key:
#      <input name="key" val="default_key"></input>
#      <br>
#      Choose a letter:
#      <select name="letter" multiple="true">
#        <option value="A">The letter A</option>
#        <option value="B">The letter B</option>
#      </select>
#  
#  The data from this form submission will be passed on to your spawner in
#  `self.user_options`
#  
#  Instead of a form snippet string, this could also be a callable that takes as
#  one parameter the current spawner instance and returns a string. The callable
#  will be called asynchronously if it returns a future, rather than a str. Note
#  that the interface of the spawner class is not deemed stable across versions,
#  so using this functionality might cause your JupyterHub upgrades to break.
#c.Spawner.options_form = traitlets.Undefined

## Interpret HTTP form data
#  
#  Form data will always arrive as a dict of lists of strings. Override this
#  function to understand single-values, numbers, etc.
#  
#  This should coerce form data into the structure expected by self.user_options,
#  which must be a dict, and should be JSON-serializeable, though it can contain
#  bytes in addition to standard JSON data types.
#  
#  This method should not have any side effects. Any handling of `user_options`
#  should be done in `.start()` to ensure consistent behavior across servers
#  spawned via the API and form submission page.
#  
#  Instances will receive this data on self.user_options, after passing through
#  this function, prior to `Spawner.start`.
#  
#  .. versionchanged:: 1.0
#      user_options are persisted in the JupyterHub database to be reused
#      on subsequent spawns if no options are given.
#      user_options is serialized to JSON as part of this persistence
#      (with additional support for bytes in case of uploaded file data),
#      and any non-bytes non-jsonable values will be replaced with None
#      if the user_options are re-used.
#c.Spawner.options_from_form = traitlets.Undefined

## Interval (in seconds) on which to poll the spawner for single-user server's
#  status.
#  
#  At every poll interval, each spawner's `.poll` method is called, which checks
#  if the single-user server is still running. If it isn't running, then
#  JupyterHub modifies its own state accordingly and removes appropriate routes
#  from the configurable proxy.
#c.Spawner.poll_interval = 30

## The port for single-user servers to listen on.
#  
#  Defaults to `0`, which uses a randomly allocated port number each time.
#

#c.Spawner.ssl_alt_names_include_local = True

## Timeout (in seconds) before giving up on starting of single-user server.
#  
#  This is the timeout for start to return, not the timeout for the server to
