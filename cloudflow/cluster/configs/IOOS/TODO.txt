TODO: add descriptive Name tag for the job via command line and not here. 
Change the configs:
1. deployment and image, subnet, security groups, ami, etc.
2. job configuration - number of nodes, descriptive name, job specific stuff

Config 1 is set someplace automatically on deployment or image update
Config 2 is per user, some stuff is needed for cluster, some stuff is needed for job.
Make it yaml with different sections instead of JSON
