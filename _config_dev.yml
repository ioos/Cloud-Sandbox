# Welcome to Jekyll!
#
# This config file is meant for settings that affect your entire site, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely need to edit after that.
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# `jekyll serve`. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site Settings: only include setting for development on 'localhost' to override
# GitHub settings:

url                      : "http://localhost:4000"
baseurl                  : "/ioos-documentation-jekyll-skeleton"
