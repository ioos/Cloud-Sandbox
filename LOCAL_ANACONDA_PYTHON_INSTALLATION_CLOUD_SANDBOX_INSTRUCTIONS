######## Installing Anaconda environment for local ec2-user on ioos Cloud-Sandbox ########

Step #1 (Setup and create a unique directory for installation
cd /save/ec2-user/Affiliation; mkdir FirstName_LastName_Anaconda_Installation; cd FirstName_LastName_Anaconda_Installation

Step #2 (Downloading latest Anaconda installation shell script)
wget https://repo.continuum.io/archive/Anaconda3-2024.10-1-Linux-x86_64.sh

Step #3 (Open executable permissions to the Anaconda installation shell script)
chmod +x Anaconda3-2024.10-1-Linux-x86_64.sh

Step #5 (Execute the Anaconda installation shell script and follow instructions)
./Anaconda3-2024.10-1-Linux-x86_64.sh

  Sub-step #1
  Hit enter to scroll through the Anaconda license agreement until you go to “yes” or “no” command line inquiry. Then answer "yes" in the command line

  Sub-step #2
  Next Step here, you will want to specify your specific pathway to your own affiliation directory on the Cloud-Sandbox that you will know it’s your own Anaconda environment e.g. /pathway/to/FirstName_LastName_Anaconda_Installation/anaconda3

  Sub-step #3
  After the installation is complete of all the Python libraries, modules, etc. for the baseline Anaconda environment, it will ask you whether or not you want to modify the .bashrc script to automatically point to your installation when you log in. You answer "no" to this question so other ec2-users don't also automatically point to your Anaconda environment when they log in as well.

Step #6 (Go into your new Anaconda installation bin directory)
cd /pathway/to/FirstName_LastName_Anaconda_Installation/anaconda3/bin

Step #7 (Execute Anaconda commands to properly install the archive libraries since this installation was not installed in a root environment. This gets around issues with installing Anaconda into a seperate local directory and breaking the conda executable)

  Sub-step #1
  ./conda install -n base libarchive -c main --force-reinstall --solver classic

  Sub-step #2
  ./conda update --all --solver=classic

Step #8 (Finally, install the default library dependencies to run the ioos Cloud-Sandbox code base for your Python executable. The libraries listed here are the default requirements to run the code base. Users can choose to just install pip and use that method instead to install libraries in their own unqiue methods if so desired)
./conda install -c conda-forge pip boto3 prefect=0.15.13 dask distributed Pillow matplotlib netCDF4 numpy pyproj haikunator


######## You are now all done and ready to go as a ec2-user with their own seperate Python installation to utilize! ########
