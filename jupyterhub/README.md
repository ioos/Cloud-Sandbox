# JupyterHub Setup Instructions

The Cloud Sandbox setup will automatically install the JupyterHub dependencies. However, additional configuration is required in order to enable user authentication.

- JupyterHub install path: `/opt/jupyterhub`
- JupyterHub config: `/opt/jupyterhub/jupyterhub_config.py`
- Nginx config: `/etc/nginx/conf.d/jupyterhub.conf`

## Google Authentication

See [these instructions](https://oauthenticator.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started.html#google-setup) for configuring your Google credentials with OAuthenticator. You will [create a key on the Google platform](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2) and modify the JupyterHub config to have the public key.

Once you've created the key, modify `/opt/jupyterhub/jupyterhub_config.py` values:

```
c.GoogleOAuthenticator.client_id = "your_client_id"
c.GoogleOAuthenticator.client_secret = "your_client_secret"
```

## Adding Users

First, create the Linux user account if it doesn't already exist on the system.

```
sudo useradd example_user
sudo usermod -aG wheel example_user
```

Next, fill out the username mapping to map the Google user to a local Unix user. For example:

```
c.Authenticator.username_map = { "example_user@gmail.com": "example_user" }
```

Optionally, you can assign administrators using the `c.Authenticator.admin_users` setting:

```
c.Authenticator.admin_users = {'example_user@gmail.com'}
```

## Setting up SSL/HTTPS

It is recommended to run Nginx as a reverse proxy to your JupyterHub instance. 
Nginx is installed as part of the Cloud Sandbox installation but additional configuration is likely needed for custom deployments. 
Follow [these instructions](https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub-the-hard-way/blob/HEAD/docs/installation-guide-hard.md#using-nginx) to configure Nginx. 

If you are planning on running SSL/HTTPS, you will need to generate your own certificates and point the Nginx configuration to those.

## Debugging

The JupyterHub logs are part of the `jupyterhub.service`. To inspect the logs:

```
sudo systemctl status jupyterhub.service
```

The JupyterHub service usually needs to be restarted for configuration changes to take effect. To restart the service:

```
sudo systemctl restart jupyterhub.service
```
