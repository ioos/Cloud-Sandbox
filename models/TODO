TODO:
Determine structure for models and coupledness.

What scripts and other files that are model specific should be part of the Cloud-Sandbox repo or should stay with the model repo.

Example: LiveOcean: we have been keeping everthing in the LiveOcean repo on asascience github. With so many different models being used now, this can make it difficult to manage.

Module file should be included with the sandbox code since it is deployment specific.

At a minimum, a script to fetch and to build each model/system should be in the sandbox repo. 

Often times the model provided build scripts or config files need to be changed to work in this environment
