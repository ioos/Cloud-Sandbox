Work on optimizing disk i/o performance. 
Try building model with pio and/or parallel netcdf as mentioned by John W.
Don't output restart every day, just the last day of run.
Test i/o again using FSx Lustre workflow.
Skip copy to/from /ptmp in operational scripts.
    Since /ptmp and /com are on same EFS volume, can change cp to mv for forecast results copy back to /com
