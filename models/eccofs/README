ECCOFS is a ROMS based model and has been setup to build and run in the nosofs.v3.6.6 framework.

Notes:
Real time initial conditions are still in development.
We have forcing data available for 2011-2023 for running hindcasts.
We have a coldstart initial condition for 2019010100 we can use to start.

Certain fixed field files are required by the operational run scripts which we are using here.
The fix files are incomplete and are really just there to make the operational run-scripts happy without making major changes to the operational scripts.
It's a step towards eccofs becoming operational.
These are downloaded and placed in the proper "fix" folder within the nosofs folder.

To setup:
(Make sure the paths are set to use your personal directories before running the scripts)

setup_eccofs.sh    - This script clones the nosofs source and ROMS eccofs, builds it, and also
                     retrieves the forcing files and fix field files.

    setup_eccofs.sh calls the following scripts:
        get_eccofs_fixfiles_s3.sh
        get_forcing_data_s3.sh
        $MODEL_DIR/sorc/build-eccofs-only.sh  - contained in nosofs repository

build_eccofs.sh    - This script can be used to just rebuild the ROMS eccofs executable.

restart_date.sh    - A helper script to get the next available start date from a restart file,
                     to help setup a run to continue a previous run.

To run:

You can use cloudflow/worflows/workflow_main.py to run your job.
It is currently setup and tested using the flows.py::forecast_flow().
This uses the same workflow and scripts used for the nosofs forecasts.

Modify and use the following job config files for each step.

1. Run the 1 day coldstart for 20190101
  jobs/ config: eccofs.coldstart
  template: templates/eccofs.coldstart.ocean.in

2. Run the forecast for 20190102
  jobs/ config: eccofs.fcst
      Set NTIMES= how ever many days you want to run
  template: templates/eccofs.ocean.in
  The workflow will copy the coldstart restart file automatically
  in the get_forcing step of the workflow. For now it will only copy the day previous to CDATE
  restart file if it exists in the expected /com folder.

3. Continuing runs:
  See jobs/ config: eccofs.fcst.continue
  CDATE and ININAME need to be manually configured based on your previous run date 
  and forecast length.
  Use restart_date.sh script to help setup the job if not sure how long the previous one ran.
  Example: 
    Assume the run in 2. above was set to run 48 hours
    The next date to run to contiue it will be 20190104 00Z 
    The restart file needed to start the new run will be in 
    under /com/<username>/nosofs/eccofs.20190102/eccofs.20190102.rst.nc
    Run ./restart_date.sh /com/<username>/nosofs/eccofs.20190102/eccofs.20190102.rst.nc
    This will output 2019010400, confirming that the restart exists for that CDATE.
    Set CDATE to that date (YYYYMMDD) and ININAME to that restart file.
    Then launch the job.

You can use cloudflow/worflows/workflow_main.py to run your job. 
It is currently setup and tested using the flows.py::forecast_flow().
This uses the same workflow and scripts used for the nosofs forecasts.
