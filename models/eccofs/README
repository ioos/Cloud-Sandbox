ECCOFS is a ROMS based model and has been setup to build in the nosofs.v3.5.0 build framework.

To setup:
Make sure the paths are set to use your personal directories before running the scripts:
get_src_and_build.sh
get_testcase_inputs.sh

To run:
See example job configs in cloudflow/job/jobs:
eccofs.hcast.1stday
eccofs.hcast.subseqdays

You can use cloudflow/worflows/workflow_main.py to run your job. It is setup to use the flows.py::multi_hindcast_flow().

ROMS namelist input ocean.in is templated using job/templates:
roms_nl_eccofs_1st_day.in
roms_nl_eccofs_subseq_days.in
