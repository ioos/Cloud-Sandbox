# IOOS Cloud Sandbox

The IOOS Cloud Sandbox is a collaborative platform for running regional coastal models in the cloud.
It provides repeatable configurations, model code and required libraries, input data, and analysis of model outputs. The Sandbox supports not only the development of services and models, but also Cloud HPC to run and validate the models. The sandbox is intended for use across industries and is inclusive to anyone who wants to develop, enhance, and run coastal models.

The Cloud Sandbox has been used to run:

- Operational versions of the [NOSOFS ROMS and FVCOM Models](https://github.com/ioos/nosofs-NCO)
- [LiveOcean model](https://comt.ioos.us/projects/liveocean) from the University of Washington
- ESMF Coupled WRF/ROMS
- ADCIRC hurricane test cases
- [CORA ADCIRC](https://registry.opendata.aws/noaa-nos-cora/) model
- [SCHISM](https://ccrm.vims.edu/schismweb/)
- [National Water Model](https://water.noaa.gov/about/nwm)


### I want to...

- Run a model in an existing cloud sandbox
    - [NOS OFS Models](NOSOFS-MODELS.md)
    - [LiveOcean Model](LIVEOCEAN-MODEL.md)

- [Deploy a new cloud sandbox](DEPLOYMENT.md)
