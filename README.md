# IOOS Cloud-Sandbox

## Getting Started

### Sandbox Installation Instructions
_Create the sandbox in AWS using Terraform_

Terraform will create **all** of the AWS resources needed for the sandbox. 
This includes the VPC, subnet, security groups, EFS networked disk volumes, and others. AWS has a default limit of 5 VPCs per region. You will have to request a quota increase from AWS if you are already at your limit.

Install the AWS CLI: <br>
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html

Make sure the CLI is configured to use your AWS account: <br>
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-quickstart.html#cli-configure-quickstart-config

Install the Terraform CLI: <br>
https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html

Run the following command to finish installation: 
```
terraform init
```

Clone this repository: <br>
(e.g. using the default path ./Cloud-Sandbox)
```
git clone https://github.com/ioos/Cloud-Sandbox.git
cd ./Cloud-Sandbox/terraform
```

Terraform requires an existing key-pair to provide SSH access to the instance(s). The public key will be added to the created instance when it is created. Then the private key can be used to login it.

There are multiple ways to provide an acceptable key. You can use an existing key-pair that you have access to, or you can create a new one. I will describe two ways to create a new AWS EC2 key-pair, one using the AWS EC2 Console and the other using the AWS CLI.

**Using the AWS EC2 Console:**

Select "Key Pairs" under "Network & Security", then select "Create key pair" _(see screenshot below)_. **Save this private key someplace safe!** 

![AWS Console](./images/AWS-Key-pairs-screen.png)

**Using the AWS CLI:**

<pre>
aws ec2 create-key-pair --key-name <b><i>your-key-pair</i></b> --query "KeyMaterial" --output text > <b><i>your-key-pair.pem</i></b> 
</pre>
The private key file must have permissions that allows access only to you, e.g. if on Linux 

<pre>
chmod 600 <b><i>your-key-pair.pem</i></b> 
</pre>

**To obtain the public key from the private key:**<br>
_(You will need to cut and paste the key into the public_key variable mentioned below.)_

<pre>
ssh-keygen -y -f <b><i>your-key-pair.pem</i></b> 
</pre>

### Set the required variables for your use:

**_mysettings.tfvars_** - Edit this file to specify custom values to use for the following:

#### These must be defined, no default exists:
allowed_ssh_cidr = "your publicly visible IPv4 address/32" <br>
key_name = "**_your-key-pair_**" <br>
public_key = "**ssh-rsa** &nbsp;&nbsp; your_public_key" <br>
_(must include "ssh-rsa", assuming it is an rsa key)_

**You can get your publicly visible IPv4 address here:** <br> 
https://www.whatismyip.com/ 

#### Optionally change these settings to override the defaults:

| Variable              | Description                                  | Default value                  |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **preferred_region**  | The AWS region to use                        | "us-east-1"                    |
| **instance_name**     | The "Name" tag for the instance              | "IOOS Cloud Sandbox Terraform" |
| **project_name**      | The "Project" tag for the resources created  | "IOOS-cloud-sandbox"           |
| **availability_zone** | The AWS Availability zone                    | "us-east-1a"                   |
| **instance_type**     | EC2 Instance type to use for setup           | "t3.medium"                 |

Run 'terrform plan' to check for errors and see what resources will be created: 
```
terraform plan -var-file="mysettings.tfvars"
```

Run 'terraform apply' to create the AWS resources.
```
terraform apply -var-file="mysettings.tfvars"
```

Enter 'yes' to create the resources.

### Install all of the required software and libraries
This is done automatically in init_template.tpl <br>
Wait for the setup to complete.


Details about the created instance and how to login will be output.<br>
It takes about 15 minutes for the entire setup to complete.<br>
Wait a few minutes before logging in.

```
Example output:
instance_id = "i-01346de00e778f"
instance_public_dns = "ec2-3-219-217-151.compute-1.amazonaws.com"
instance_public_ip = "3.219.217.151"
login_command = "ssh -i <path-to-key>/my-sandbox.pem centos@ec2-3-219-217-151.compute-1.amazonaws.

```
To watch the progress:
```
ssh -i my-sandbox.pem centos@ec2-3-219-217-151.compute-1.amazonaws
tail -f /tmp/setup.log
```

### Create the AMI 
This is done automatically.
The AMI ID will be found at the end of the log at /tmp/setup.log
It can also be found in the AWS console or via the AWS CLI. This AMI ID will be needed later.

### Install the NOS OFS ROMS and FVCOM models
```
ssh -i <your-key.pem> centos@<your-ec2-instance>
cd /save
git clone https://github.com/ioos/nosofs-NCO.git
cd nosofs-NCO/sorc

# To build everything
./ROMS_COMPILE.sh
./FVCOM_COMPILE.sh
```

### Optional: After setting everything up, you can change the instance type to something smaller:
Edit mysettings.tfvars and change the following:

Example: <br>
instance_type = "t3.micro" <br>

Run terraform apply:
```
terraform apply -var-file="mysettings.tfvars"
```
### Verified the following works on July 14, 2021: 
    Setup the node and build an AMI from an instance that does not support EFA
    Use that AMI for an EFA supported instance and EFA will work

[//]: # "terraform destroy -target=resource"

### When done using the sandbox all of the AWS resources (including disks) can be destroyed with the following command:
```
terraform destroy -var-file="mysettings.tfvars"
```

### The following document contains some older instructions on building and running the models that is still valid.

### Workflows

How to setup the workflows:

1. Setup the machine configuration files for the forecast and/or post processing.

See: workflow_main.py - This is the main entry point. 

There are two configuration files that need to be specified. These should be changed for your particular cloud configuration. These correspond to the machine configuration used for the forecast and post processing flows.

Examples:

fcstconf = f'{curdir}/../configs/cbofs.config'

postconf = f'{curdir}/../configs/post.config'

2. Setup the job configuration files. 

These are provided as command line arguments to workflow_main.py or a copy of it.

For examples:

See:

 jobs/cbofs.00z.fcst (forecast)

 and

 jobs/cbofs.00z.plots (plots)

To submit the job(s) (and to optionally log to an output file and run as a background process):

./workflow_main.py jobs/yourjob1 [jobs/yourjob2] 2>&1 someoutfile &

Note: job2 will only run if job1 finishes without error.

If using the cloud, cloud resources will be provisioned for you, based on the configuration files specified in step 1. The cloud resources will be automatically terminated when each flow ends, whether successfully or not.

To customize the flows see: flows.py
To add any additional tasks, see: workflow_tasks.py

To add additional Job functionality or define new Job types:
  See the classes in the ./job folder.

To add additional Cluster functionality or define new Cluster implementations:
  See the classes in the ./cluster folder.

See the ./plotting folder for plotting jobs.
